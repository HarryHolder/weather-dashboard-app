# weather-dashboard-app
An app using APIs to get weather information from around the world

## Description 
This project was built after several lessons on API's. It involved calling twwo different API's, the first to get co-ordinates of a searched location and the second to use those co-ordinates to get todays weather, and a forcast for the next 5 days. It also have several functions using local storage to set previous searches and dynamically create a button for them so a user can quickly view a already searched location. There is also a button added to quickly clear both the local storage and the div of buttons for previous searched places.

## Usage
The app has a simple function. There is a input field with a search button which when clicked returns the information requested by the user. Below is a gif of the page in action, and a link to the repo and the deployed page.
